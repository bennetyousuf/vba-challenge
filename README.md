# vba-challenge 

## Objective
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
- The ticker symbol.
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Script is developed and tested in the Test file (alphabetical_testing.xlsm) to reduce testing time before applying and running to our larger and final data set (multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm). Raw Data and Final Images for each year included in their respective directories.
